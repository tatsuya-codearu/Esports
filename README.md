#Bugs
-If you go to the COD League and select COD MW2 then try to return to previous page you will enter a blank screen effectively,
instead of going back to the original COD League select page.


#State of Application
-Early stages of development with the main links leading to a page. This is because not only are most pages blank
but on the browser tab the wesbite is still called a react app.
-Most pages were blank so i had to grab the url name in order to verify if links worked.
